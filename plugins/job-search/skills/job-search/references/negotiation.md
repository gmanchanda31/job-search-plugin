**DISCLAIMER:** This guide is not financial advice. Consult with HR professionals, tax advisors, and career coaches for important financial decisions specific to your situation.

## 1. Salary Research

### Web Search Patterns
- **Glassdoor** - Company reviews + salary ranges (search "Company + Salary + Role")
- **AmbitionBox** - India-focused, CTC breakdowns, interview insights
- **Levels.fyi** - Tech roles, detailed leveling, company-specific bands
- **Blind** - Anonymous posts, real offers (filter by company/location)
- **PayScale** - Adjustable for location, experience, education

### Indian CTC Breakdown
Understand each component when comparing offers:
- **Base Salary** - Fixed monthly pay
- **HRA** - House Rent Allowance (typically 10-30% of base)
- **Special Allowance** - Taxable component
- **PF Contribution** - Employer contribution (12%)
- **Variable Pay** - Bonus, performance incentive (often capped in first year)
- **Stock** - ESOP vesting (4-year cliff common)
- **Other** - LTA, medical, conveyance

**Total CTC ≠ Take-home Pay** - Account for taxes, PF deductions.

### US/Global Structure
- **Base** - Fixed annual salary
- **Equity** - RSUs/stock options (4-year vesting, 1-year cliff typical)
- **Bonus** - Target % of base (50-200% common in tech)
- **Benefits** - 401k match, health insurance, PTO, relocation
- **Sign-on Bonus** - One-time cash (negotiate separately)

### Adjustment Factors
- Location multiplier (SF Bay > Austin > Mid-West)
- Company stage (startup < mid-size < FAANG)
- Experience level (IC1-7 bands vary 2-5x)
- In-demand skills (AI/ML, DevOps premium; QA lower)
- Unemployment/employment status

## 2. Leverage Assessment

### Increases Your Leverage
✓ Competing offer (genuine and signable)
✓ Specialized/rare skills
✓ Their urgent hiring timeline
✓ Your switching cost (equity vesting, competitor noncompete)
✓ Market scarcity (recent trend)

### Decreases Your Leverage
✗ Long unemployment gap
✗ Visa dependency (H1B, L1, relocation required)
✗ Single-company background
✗ Early career stage
✗ Market oversupply in your role

### Honest Assessment
Rate yourself on 1-5 scale across above factors. 13+ = strong leverage. 8-12 = moderate. <8 = limited - focus on non-salary benefits.

## 3. Negotiation Strategies

### Anchor High (15-20% Above Target)
- Research range beforehand; ask 15-20% above midpoint
- They expect negotiation; anchoring high creates room
- Example: Target ₹25L CTC → Ask ₹29-30L

### Total Comp Reframe
If base is capped, negotiate the full package:
- "What flexibility exists on equity/signing bonus/PTO/stock options?"
- Equity vesting schedules (push cliff from 1y to 0.5y if possible)
- Sign-on bonus helps offset current job loss

### Competing Offer Play
- "I have another offer, and I prefer your company. What can you improve?"
- Only mention if genuine; never fabricate
- Show interest first, then mention offer; reverses power dynamic

### Delay Tactic
- Request 48-72 hours to review (buying time for other offers)
- "I need to discuss with family/advisor before committing"
- Deadlines often extend if you're top choice

### Creative Package Approach
If cash is locked:
- Remote work days (WFH 3-4 days/week)
- Learning budget (₹50K-₹1L/year)
- Conference attendance
- Accelerated review cycle (6-month review instead of 12)
- Flexible hours, sabbatical policy

## 4. Scripts for Common Scenarios

**Receiving Initial Offer:**
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role. Let me review the details and get back to you in 48 hours."
*Never accept immediately.*

**Countering Low Offer:**
"I appreciate the offer. Based on market research for [role/location/level], I was expecting ₹X-Y range. Can you revisit?"
*Provide data sources (Levels.fyi link, etc.).*

**"This is Our Best Offer":**
"I understand budget constraints. Beyond base, can we explore signing bonus, accelerated stock vesting, or remote flexibility?"

**With Competing Offer:**
"I have an offer from [Company] at ₹X. I prefer your company culture/tech stack. Can you match or improve?"

**Without Competing Offer:**
"Based on my research and experience, the market rate is ₹X. I'm targeting that range. How can we close the gap?"

**Negotiating Equity (Startups/Tech):**
"What's the vesting schedule? Can we reduce the cliff to 6 months? What percentage dilution is expected?"

**Notice Period Buyout (India):**
"My current notice is 3 months. Can you offer a buyout or provide time to serve notice and join?"

## 5. Comparison Framework

| Component | Current | Offer | Target | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|-----|
| Base CTC | ₹20L | ₹22L | ₹26L | -₹4L |
| Variable (guaranteed yr 1) | ₹2L | ₹1.5L | ₹3L | -₹1.5L |
| Stock (annual) | ₹0 | ₹2L | ₹3L | -₹1L |
| Bonus | 10% | 15% | 15% | ✓ |

**Total Comp Year 1:** ₹25L (current) vs ₹28.5L (offer) vs ₹32L (target)

**Hidden Value:** Brand strength (resume weight), learning curve, network expansion, 2-3 year career trajectory boost.

**Walk-Away Number:** Define minimum acceptable before negotiating. Stick to it.

## 6. Accepting / Declining

**Accepting:**
Get written confirmation before resigning:
"Thank you for the revised offer. I accept the position of [Role] with [Company] at [CTC/package]. Please send written confirmation."

**Declining Professionally:**
"Thank you for the opportunity. I'm moving forward with another offer that aligns better with my current priorities. I appreciate your time."
*Keep door open for future.*

**Resigning Current Job:**
- Provide written resignation notice (meeting + email)
- Serve full notice period (honor commitments)
- Document knowledge transfer
- Don't badmouth company; maintain relationships

## 7. Indian-Specific Considerations

**CTC Negotiation:**
- Most negotiable: base + variable (guarantee % for yr 1)
- Less negotiable: HRA (set by policy)
- Question: "What's the variable pay guarantee in year 1?"

**Variable Pay:**
- Negotiate guarantee percentage (e.g., 50% guaranteed, 50% performance-based)
- Clarify measurement criteria (individual goals vs team vs company)

**Notice Period Buyout:**
- Standard: 1-2 months buyout fee common
- Negotiate: "Can you pay 3 months salary to exit immediately?"
- Timing: Buyout often absorbed by new company HR

**Gratuity & PF:**
- Gratuity: Earned after 5 years (41.67 × months/12)
- Ask about accelerated gratuity policy
- PF: Employer contributes 12% (becomes your retirement fund)

**Relocation Allowance:**
- If relocating: ₹50K-₹5L typical (depends on company/city)
- Negotiate separately from CTC
- Ask for flexible timing to arrange logistics

## 8. Red Flags & Final Tips

🚩 **Red Flags:**
- Offer withdrawn after negotiation (sign of unstable company)
- Vague equity details (push for specifics)
- No written confirmation of verbal offer
- Continuous lowball follow-ups

✅ **Final Checklist:**
- [ ] Research comp data (3+ sources)
- [ ] Know your walk-away number
- [ ] Assess leverage honestly
- [ ] Never accept immediately
- [ ] Get everything in writing
- [ ] Negotiate total comp, not just base
- [ ] Maintain professionalism throughout
- [ ] Thank them even if declining

**Remember:** Negotiation is expected. Companies budget for it. You're not being greedy by asking for market rate.
