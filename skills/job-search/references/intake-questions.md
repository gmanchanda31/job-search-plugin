# Job Search Intake Questionnaire Reference

## Opening the Conversation
Start naturally—this is a collaborative chat, not a form. Set expectations warmly.

**Opening lines:**
- "Let's get a clear picture of what you're looking for and where you're at in your job search. This'll help me give you better guidance."
- "I'd like to understand your background and what kind of role would be a great fit. Should take about 10-15 minutes."

**Key principle:** Listen more than you ask. Let answers flow; follow up on interesting details.

---

## Identity & Experience

### Current Role & Background
- "What's your current role and how long have you been in it?"
- "What's your title, and what do people outside your company think you do?" (reveals how they position themselves)
- **Follow-up if vague:** "Walk me through a typical week—what takes up most of your time?"

### Skills & Expertise
- "What are the 3-4 things you're genuinely good at that you'd want to use in your next role?"
- "Any technical skills, tools, or methodologies you've mastered?" (code languages, frameworks, PLCs, SAP, etc.)
- **For non-technical roles:** "What processes or functions have you led or owned?"

### Education & Credentials
- "What's your educational background?" (degree, field, university)
- "Any certifications, bootcamps, or specialized training?" (MBA, AWS, CPA, Design Thinking, etc.)

### Resume Readiness
- "Do you have an updated resume? Can you tell me what's on it?" (or share it if they have one)
- **Red flag check:** "Any resume gaps or transitions we should frame strategically?"

## Target Role & Growth

### Desired Titles & Functions
- "What title(s) are you targeting, or what kind of work excites you?"
- **If unclear:** "Are you looking to stay in [current function] or shift? What would feel like growth?"

### Industry & Domain Preferences
- "Any specific industries calling to you? Any you'd avoid?"
- "Does the space matter? (e.g., fintech, climate, health tech, traditional corporate)"

### Company Stage & Size
- "Startup, scale-up, or established company? Or you're open?"
- "Team size matter? (solopreneur teams vs 50+ person groups)"
- **Probe:** "What appeals to you about that stage?" (autonomy, stability, equity upside, etc.)

### Seniority & Scope
- "Are you looking to grow into a leadership/management role, or stay hands-on?"
- "Any appetite for P&L ownership, team leadership, or strategic projects?"

---

## Logistics & Constraints

### Location & Mobility
- "Where are you based, and are you open to relocation?"
- "Remote, hybrid, office—what works for your lifestyle?"

### Visa & Work Authorization
- **For India:** "Are you currently on H1-B, L1, or looking to move abroad?"
- **For global:** "Do you need visa sponsorship, or are you already authorized to work?"
- **Follow-up:** "Any countries you're particularly interested in or want to avoid?"

### Notice Period & Timeline
- **For India:** "What's your current notice period? (60, 90, or negotiable?)"
- **For everyone:** "When could you realistically start?"

### Constraints & Deal-Breakers
- "Anything non-negotiable on logistics?" (can't relocate, must stay remote, etc.)

---

## Compensation & Benefits

### Base Salary / CTC Floor
- **For India:** "What's your current CTC, and what's the baseline you're targeting?" (break down base vs. variable if relevant)
- **For US/global:** "What's your current base, and what range are you targeting?"
- **Sensitivity tip:** "I ask because matching expectations early saves time for everyone."

### Total Compensation Target
- "Is base the main driver, or does equity/bonus/benefits matter too?"
- **For startups:** "How do you think about equity vesting and upside?"
- **For corporates:** "What does benefits matter most—401k match, health, PTO, flexibility?"

### Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves
- "On compensation: what's non-negotiable, and what's flexible?"
- "Are there benefits that'd move the needle?" (flexible PTO, learning budget, parental leave, etc.)

### Red Flags on Comp
- "Any red flags from your last role?" (delayed payment, equity never vesting, etc.)

## Culture, Values & Fit

### What They Optimize For

### Red Flags & Deal-Breakers
- "What drove you to look? Anything you're running *from*?"
- "Any company cultures or management styles that are absolute no-gos?"

## Current Pipeline & Momentum

### Referrals & Network
- "Do you have strong referrals at any target companies?"
- "Anyone in your network you could leverage for warm intros?"

### Timeline Reality Check
- "If you got an offer tomorrow, would you take it, or are you still exploring?"

---

## Dream Companies & Watchlist

### Target List
- "Are there 5-10 companies you'd love to work for?"
- "Why those? What appeals about them?"
- **If stuck:** "Any companies you admire in [industry]? What do they do well?"

### Competitive Landscape
- "Are there direct competitors we should also consider?"
- "Any companies to avoid that have different values/practices?"

### Outreach Strategy

## Wrap-Up & Next Steps

## Intake Tips

**For Sensitive Topics:**
- Salary expectations: "No judgment here—helps me advocate for the right roles."
- Reason for leaving: Listen without fixing. Common reasons: growth limits, management, culture fit, life change.
- Long gaps: Normalize; frame as choice or growth time, not red flag.

**India-Specific Context:**
- CTC includes base + bonus + benefits; probe separately for true base salary.
- 60-90 day notice periods are standard; some roles allow buyouts.
- Visa sponsorship (H1-B, L1) is common but competitive; clarify appetite and experience.

**Global Context:**
- Equity: Ask about vesting schedules, strike price, preference shares (stock options vs. RSUs).
- Visa sponsorship: Expensive ($2-5k per hire); some companies only sponsor senior roles.
- Relocation packages: Typical for C-suite and senior hires; senior IC might be negotiable.

**Active Listening Cues:**
- Pause after questions—let them think and fill silence.
- Reflect back: "So you're really energized by product strategy and cross-functional impact?"
- Note contradictions gently: "Interesting—you mentioned stability matters, but you're also interested in early-stage startups?"

## Assessment Framework

After intake, synthesize into a 3-line profile:
1. **Identity:** Current role, key skills, seniority level
2. **Target:** Role type, industry, company stage preferences
3. **Constraints:** Location, visa, notice period, comp floor, 2-3 must-haves

**Example:**
> Senior Product Manager (5 yrs fintech) → CPO/Head of Product (Series B-C, fintech or climate, 50-500 person teams) → Remote/SF, no visa needed, $180-220k base, needs strong product strategy ownership and distributed team experience.

Use this to generate tailored opportunities and warm intro strategy.
