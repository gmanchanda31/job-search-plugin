## 2. Question Categories & Frameworks

### Behavioral Questions (STAR Method)
**Structure**: Situation → Task → Action → Result

**Common themes**:
- **Conflict**: Disagreement with team/manager
- **Failure**: Project that didn't work, mistakes learned from
- **Leadership**: Led without authority, mentored someone, raised standards
- **Ambiguity**: Unclear requirements, shifting priorities, incomplete info
- **Deadlines**: Tight timeline, shipping quality under pressure

**STAR Template**:
- *Situation*: Context, team size, constraints (1-2 sentences)
- *Task*: Your specific role/responsibility
- *Action*: What YOU did (use "I", not "we")
- *Result*: Quantified outcome (improved X%, shipped Y days early, gained Z customers)

### Technical/Domain Questions

**For Product Managers**:
- **Product sense**: How would you improve feature X?
- **Metrics**: What metrics matter for this product?
- **Prioritization**: How do you decide what to build?
- **Estimation**: How many daily active users does feature X have?
- **Trade-offs**: Speed vs. quality, user acquisition vs. retention

**For Engineers**:
- **System design**: Architecture decisions, scalability
- **Problem-solving**: Coding challenges, debugging approach
- **Decision justification**: Why that tech stack or approach?

### Culture Fit Questions
- "Why do you want to join us?" (Show research + genuine fit)
- "What motivates you?" (Align with company values)
- "How do you handle feedback/failure?"
- "What kind of culture do you thrive in?"

### Case Studies & Take-homes
- **Structure**: Clarify ambiguity → framework → analysis → recommendation
- **Do's**: Ask clarifying questions, show your thinking, consider trade-offs
- **Don'ts**: Jump to answers, ignore context, over-complicate

## 3. Answer Preparation

### Experience Bank: Build 5-6 Versatile Stories
Reference your **JOBSEARCH.md** for these story categories:

1. **Impact story**: Quantified results, cross-functional collaboration
2. **Challenge story**: Overcome obstacles, learned something
3. **Technical decision**: Why you chose X approach, tradeoffs
4. **Conflict/disagreement**: Handled respectfully, good outcome
5. **Feedback/growth**: Received criticism, improved, proved it
6. **Ambiguity story**: Unclear brief, made decisions, shipped

Each story should be: ~90 seconds, includes metrics/proof, shows your values.

### Handling "I Don't Have That Experience"
- **Reframe**: "I haven't done exactly that, but I've handled similar in [story]"
- **Bridge**: "Here's how I'd approach it based on what I know..."
- **Genuine**: "I'm excited to learn that here—here's how I learn fast"
- Never: Lie, over-claim, or seem defensive

## 4. Questions to Ask the Interviewer

### Early Stage (Recruiter/Coordinator)
- "What does success look like in this role at 90 days, 1 year?"
- "What's the team structure and how does this role fit?"
- "What are the top 3 challenges the team faces right now?"

### Mid Stage (Hiring Manager)
- "Can you tell me about your approach to mentoring/team development?"
- "How do you measure success for this role?"
- "What does a day-to-day look like for this position?"

### Leadership/Final Round
- "What's the vision for this team over the next 2 years?"
- "How do you think about innovation vs. stability here?"
- "What's the biggest challenge the company is solving right now?"

### Avoid
- "What does the company do?" (Shows no research)
- Salary/benefits in early rounds (wait for offer discussion)
- "Tell me about the company culture" (Too generic)
